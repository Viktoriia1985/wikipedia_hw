                    <p>SpongeBob SquarePants (also simply referred to as SpongeBob) is an American animated comedy
                        television series created by marine science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg for
                        Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and
                        his aquatic friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The
                        fifth-longest-running American animated series, its popularity has made it a media
                        franchise. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon and it is the most
                        distributed property from ViacomCBS Networks International. The media franchise has
                        generated more than $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.[6][needs update]

                        Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational
                        book that Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.[7] He began
                        developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 following the
                        cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to
                        Nickelodeon. He turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on that series, to voice the
                        title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series
                        called SpongeBoy Ahoy!; both of these were changed as the name was already trademarked.

                        Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999, after it
                        aired the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It
                        has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and had gained enormous
                        popularity by its second season. A feature film, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was
                        released in theaters on November 19, 2004. A second film adaptation, The SpongeBob Movie:
                        Sponge Out of Water, followed on February 6, 2015. A third film and prequel to the
                        television series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released in Canadian
                        theaters on August 14, 2020 followed by a premiere on video-on-demand and Paramount+ on
                        March 4, 2021. In 2018, the series began airing its twelfth season; it was renewed for a
                        thirteenth season on July 17, 2019, which began airing in October 2020.[8] As of July 30,
                        2020, all prior seasons of the show are available on Paramount+.[9]

                        SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including: six Annie Awards, eight
                        Golden
                        Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, 18 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA Children's Awards.
                        A
                        Broadway musical based on the series opened in 2017 to critical acclaim.[10] Kamp
                        Koral:
                        SpongeBob's Under Years, a spin-off series, debuted in March 2021. Two additional
                        spin-off
                        series, an untitled project based on the character Squidward Tentacles and The Patrick
                        Star
